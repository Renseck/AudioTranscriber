BEFORE FIRST RUN:

Open an Anaconda prompt, cd to the AudioTranscriber folder and run "pip install -r requirements.txt" to make sure
all important packages are installed.


USAGE:

The program currently accepts ".m4a" files (such as the ones generated by Windows' Recorder program) and ".wav" files.
Simply place these directly in the AudioTranscriber folder, where the .py file is also located.
Again in an Anaconda prompt, cd to the AudioTransciber folder. There, the command to run the script is as:

"python transcriber.py <name_of_audio_file.extension> [name_of_transcipt_file.txt]"

The argument in the square brackets is optional; the program generates a name for the transcript file automatically
if this argument is left empty (recommended). It is important you included the ".extension", .e.g ".m4a", or the program
will not find the file you are referring to.
